          This web application (<strong>“Sport Counter”</strong>) is operated by a small independent development team.<br />
          For all inquiries, please contact: <a href="mailto:barile.cec@gmail.com">barile.cec@gmail.com</a>

      <h2>2. Privacy Policy</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <p>
          We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.
          This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use <strong>Sport Counter</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Data We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          We use <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> (by Google LLC) to allow secure sign-in with your Google account.
          When you sign in, Firebase provides us with your <strong>email address</strong> and a <strong>unique user ID (UID)</strong>.
          We store this information in our secure database to link your personal account data and ensure that only you can access it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we store your usage data (such as selected resorts and related expenses) linked to your UID.
          We do not collect or process any other personal information.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Purpose and Legal Basis</h3>
        <p>We process your personal data solely to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Authenticate your account</li>
          <li>Provide personalized access to your data</li>
          <li>Calculate and display your resort statistics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The legal basis under <strong>Article 6(1)(b) GDPR</strong> is the performance of a contract,
          meaning this data is necessary for <strong>Sport Counter</strong> to function.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Data Storage and Security</h3>
        <p>
          Your data is stored in a secure database hosted within the <strong>European Union</strong> by a
          <strong>GDPR-compliant hosting provider</strong>.
          All information is transmitted over <strong>encrypted HTTPS connections</strong>, and access to the database
          is restricted to authorised system components only.
        </p>
        <p>
          We apply appropriate <strong>technical and organisational measures</strong> (such as access control,
          regular security updates, etc.) to protect your data against unauthorised access, alteration, or loss.
          No personal data are transferred outside the <strong>European Economic Area (EEA)</strong> in connection with hosting.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4 Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>
          We do not share your personal data with any third parties.
          Authentication is handled by <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> (Google LLC) in accordance with
          <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firebase may process authentication data (email address and UID) on servers located outside the EU,
          under the <strong>EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework</strong>, ensuring an adequate level of data protection.
          Google does not use Firebase Authentication data for advertising or profiling purposes.
        </p>

        <ul>

          <li>Request correction or deletion</li>
